============================================================
Plan 0.26.0

- MKC_NEED_FUNCLIBS - the same as MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS but
  implementation is taken from mk-c.
  Ex: MKC_NEED_FUNCLIBS += strlcat strlcpy getline

  Candidates: strlcpy, strlcat, getline

  Implementation details:
    *  mkc_imp.need_strlcat.mk where all checks are made
    *  include file mkc_strlcat.h from mkc special directory
    *  get mkc_strlcat.c from mkc special directory
    *  HAVE_NEED.strlcat for overriding

- Special marker for checks that cannot be possible in cross-compiling

- MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS -- source for replacement.c

- mkc_imp.pkg-config.mk: defines similar to HAVE_*

- Docuentation for OPSYS_TARGET, TOOLDIR, MACHINE_GNU_PLATFORM

- ${SRCTOP}/Makefile.common -- makefile which is included
  by all subpojects

Some thoughts inspired by talks with Michael Crogan

- MKASNEEDED=yes => ld --as-needed

- SRCDIR_<subdir> similar to OBJDIR_<subdir>

- During development of huge projects it may make sense to always keep
  "installed" version of the software somewhere (FAKEPREFIX?)
  and always keep it synced.
  mk-configure needs a mechanism to always "install"
  after "all" and "uninstall" before "clean". Options: develop this in
  mk-c and make it optional feature; provide a mechanism for
  auto-depend one target from TARGETS from another one. In the latter
  case users will be able to implement this kind of things themself.
  (myall   ->    "myall-* : all-* .WAIT install-*)
  (myclean ->  "myclean-* : uninstall-* .WAIT clean-*)

- VARIANTS for libraries.

- mkc.subprj.mk: special target for outputting a dependency graph
  taking into account NODEPS variable.

- _mkc_done_<prj>_<trg>

- project "roundup" for testing 

- Better explain how "test" target works, maybe as a couple of slides
  in the PDF presentation. With and without mkc.minitest.mk.
- One more example/ for TARGETS, demonstrating such things as
  "mkcmake release/debug/profile" or "mkcmake all_clang/all_gcc"
  or "valgrind_test"/"gcov_test" etc.
- Additional slides in PDF for virtual subprojects.
  Notes about "virtual subproject" in examples/.
- Notes in examples/hello_dictd and other examples based on
  mkc.subprj.mk about what mkc.subprj.mk really does. Reference (man page)
  is not enough for newcomers. Notes about clean-SUBPRJ, all-SUBPRJ etc.
- Better explain ../Makefile.inc included automatically. For those who
  are not familiar with *BSD it is not obvious how to use it.
- "errorcheck/configure" tests should be run in parallel. Something
  like shlock(1) or flock(1) is needed for this.
- Example is needed for how to embed autoconf-based subproject into a
  project based on mk-configure. The sad fact is autoconf/automake is
  everywhere. So, it would be nice integrate mk-c into reality.
  mkc_imp.autotools.mk is needed for this.
- Alternative .depend generation, e.g. like it is described in GNU
  make info files
- Higher priority for fixing handling of dependencies between
  libraries and programs. In addition examples/ is needed for
  triggering rebuild of subproject if "something" was rebuild in
  another subproject (build script for example).
- For better extensibility it makes sense to implement user-implementable
  pre_all, post_all, pre_install, post_install etc. targets.
- Interdependencies between targetX-subprjA and targetY-subprjB (for
  example all-prject1 and install-prject2). Maybe this is cool idea
  for examples/ and slides. I need some good example for this.
  <<<depend-project1:errorcheck-autotools_based_project2>>>!!!
- Steal cool features from Simon Gerraty's mk files and analyse
  "meta mode" he invented.
- Better support for working without installation to /. -rpath, additional
  directories for objects, binaries and libs.
- symlinks in object directories to source files for easier running
  unitest, for example. lndir(1).

Some "targets" from TARGETS should set MKCHECKS to "no"

ronn(1) : markdown to man pages

-----------------------------------------
gcc -L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib     -o hello_lex hello_lex.o   -ll
yacc    calc.y
mv y.tab.c calc.c
gcc   -I/usr/pkg/include   -c     -o calc.o calc.c
gcc -L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib     -o hello_calc calc.o
ERROR: cannot find program -y
Cannot find bison, good bye!
------------------------------------------

  Reimplement linkme.mk. It is not flexible enough.
    - Additional type of dependencies in mkc.subprjs.mk (LIBDEPS =
      libfoo:bar ...), pass them to subprojects using enironment and
      include appropriate libfoo/linkme.mk if it is
      available. Otherwise, use default -l and -I.
    or
    - keep linkme.mk and avoid direct use of CPPFLAGS, LDADD and
      DPLIBDIRS.  Instead use special variables XXX.includes,
      XXX.ldflags, XXX.ldadd, SRCDIR_<lib> and OBJDIR_<lib>.

  custom test failed -> exit status of mkcmake should not be zero
  MKC_CUSTOM_ERR.qqqq -> error message before exiting just like 

  mkcmake configure doesn't work
  New variable MKC_CUSTOM_ENV.xxx

  Add script_check to MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM
               Ex.  MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM+=               nested_funcs
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.nested_funcs=      nested_funcs.c
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.script_check=      checks/script_check

  - BINSUBDIR, LIBSUBDIR, LIBEXECSUBDIR etc...
  - Fix USE_SSP support for clang (-mllvm -stack-protector-buffer-size=1)
  - @sysconfdir@/mkc.conf
  - LDFLAGS vs. LDFLAGS in link.me (global paths before project's)
  - USE_RPATH
  - OBJCOPTS_<proj>
  - Regression tests:
    * optional .f tests
    * optional .p tests
    * optional .m tests
    * optional(!) glib2 tests

============================================================
Plan 1)

  - Support for MKDEBUG like in NetBSD mk files
  - .lua.luac:
  - Implement mkc_imp.libtool.mk to build
    the shared libraries using GNU libtool(1).
  - MKSTRIP, STRIP, mkc_install: use STRIP, not STRIPPROG

  Slides for:
    - Slide "extensibility" about Lua module.
    - code specific to GNU ld(1) (.def?)

============================================================
Plan 2)

  - ./configure written in shell?
  - EXPORT_DYNAMIC_SYMBOLS - add the specified symbols to
    dynamic symbol table (GNU ld)
  - EXPORT_SYMBOLS_REGEXP

  - recheck documentation for Makefile.rec
  - Syllable, Haiku, OpenServer/UnixWare and HURD
  - lcc and tcc compilers
  - epm -> rpm, SVR4 pkg etc.
  - mkc_imp.filelist.mk
    - FL_NOPREFIX
    - FL_PERSUBPRJ
  - IRIX: "endianess" and EXPORT_SYMBOLS

============================================================
Plan 3)

  = sample for home-made .mk file (Ocaml? Pike?)
  = marker for user's custom tests that
    run generated executables, i.e. not ready
    for cross-compilation

  = symlinks to executables and libraries in ${OBJDIR}/{bin,lib}

  = support for gettext

  = xxxDIR variable for /var

  = mkclint?

  = Command line may be limited in size.
    Save defines to config.h and set HAVE_CONFIG_H to 1
    for compiling.

  = MKC_CUSTOM_premk, MKC_CUSTOM_postmk

  = Online tutorial

  = shared libraries support for AIX, UnixWare, Hurd, Haiku.
  = shared libraries support for nwcc and other compilers.

  = Comparison with quagmire, kBuild, CMake, scons, waf, framewerk, pmk,
    MagicMakefiles, bjam, pymake, bitmake, pkgconf,
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mkbuild etc.

  = Often compilers need special options to compile pthread code.
    Support for MKPTHREAD=yes|no is needed.

  = implement MANBZ2?

  = man page for mkc_check_compiler

============================================================
Plan 4)

  = EXPORT_SYMBOLS for HP-UX, AIX, SCO etc.

  = Single cache file as an automatically loaded (if exists)
    bmake makefile.

  = Targets bin_rpm, bin_epm
  = Targets src_tar, src_targz, src_tarbz2

  = mkc.subdir.mk:
    - continue bulding even if some subprojects failed

    - MKC_CUSTOM_FN=xxx.f
    - MKC_CUSTOM_FN=xxx.objc

  = Implement mkc.qt.mk

  = Implement mkc.doxygen.mk?

============================================================
Plan 5)

  = mkc.configure.mk functionality but for bourne shell, e.g.

    Upstream creates ./configure shell script:
      MKC_CONFIG_MK=mkc_config.mk
      MKC_CONFIG_H=mkc_config.h

      MKC_CHECK_HEADERS='
        header1.h
        header2.h
        header3.h'
      MKC_CHECK_FUNCLIBS='
        func1:lib1
        func2
        func3:lib3'
      #<...>
      . mkc_configure
      mkc_run # generating mkc_config.h and mkc_config.mk

    User runs
      ./configure ...
      <any>make all

  = MKC_CHECK_DECL_TYPE (define, function|variable)

  = MKC_DEFINE_01 - -DHAVE_XXX=0 or -DHAVE_XXX=1

============================================================
