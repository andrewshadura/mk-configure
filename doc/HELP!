mk-configure project needs your help.  Any kind of feedback is
welcome.  If you like mk-configure and have some spare time, feel free
to send me suggestions, fixes, patches and so on.  If you want to
participate the project, you are welcome.  First of all, documentation
needs to be improved.  If your English is better than mine (mine is
just absent), and want to improve it, let me know.
