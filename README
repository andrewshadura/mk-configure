      mk-configure is a lightweight replacement for GNU autoconf,
             written in and for bmake (NetBSD make).

      mk-configure also provides standalone mkc_check_xxx scripts
             that can be used without bmake.

      Read TODO.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation:
   - See configure.mk[.in]
   - Read mkc_check_{decl,header,funclib,sizeof} -h
   - See EXAMPLE.Makefile,
     run bmake -f EXAMPLE.Makefile for example.

"mk-configure" is currently in alpha stage of development.

!!! API IS NOT STABLE YET AND MAY BE CHANGED IN THE NEXT RELEASE !!!

What's wrong with GNU autoconf and autotools in general (in short)?

 1) Autotools and autoconf in particular are toooooo big and toooooo
   complex.  I fear most FOSS developers do not understand how to use
   autotools in a proper way to make software really portable.

 2) configure script generated by autoconf is too big.
   Trivial configure.ac results in hundreds of kilobytes.
   What the hell?

 3) The goal of autotools was to make building software easier.
   But it is VERY inconvenient to develop autotools-based software.
   Autotools is a hell for development/developers.
   Too much of top-level commands. Also see (1).

 4) In theory, configure script generated by autoconf is portable because
   it is written in portable shell. In practice this is not always true.

 5) autoconf doesn't support efficient results caching from different
   projects. In theory this can make building thousands of projects
   (e.g. software packages in OS distros) DRAMMATICALLY faster.

 6) configure script generated by autoconf is too slow even on modern
   hardware on systems with fast fork(2) system call (*BSD, Linux).

 7) Many (most?) real-life configure.ac break the cross-compilng.

 8) In my view autotools and autoconf in particular are BADLY designed.
   I personally hate code generation because it is ... extreamly
   ugly :-/ approach.
   Today it is not a problem to install any kind of software building
   tools.

Installation:

   bsdmake PREFIX=/usr/local
   bsdmake install-dirs
   bsdmake install

"bsdmake" here is Net/Free/Open/DragonFly BSD make.

NetBSD bmake is strongly recomended.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
bmake sources are available from here:

http://www.crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html
ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/sjg/

There you can also find portable MK scripts (mk-files).
