============================================================
Plan 0.25.0

Some thoughts inspired by talks with Michael Crogan
- Doublecheck parallel all/uninstall/installation/... (incl. mkc.subprj.mk),
  appropriate regression tests, also check whether MKC_ERR_MSG,
  MKC_REQD and BMAKE_REQD work correctly with "mkcmake -jN".
- Fix LINKS and MLINKS bug with "mkcmake -jN", hardlink should be
  created after everything else (FILES, PROG, MAN etc.) is already
  installed.
- Better support for MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX , maybe target "obj" is needed.
- Better explain how "test" target works, maybe as a couple of slides
  in the PDF presentation. With and without mkc.minitest.mk.
- One more example/ for TARGETS, demonstrating such things as
  "mkcmake release/debug/profile" or "mkcmake all_clang/all_gcc"
  or "valgrind_test"/"gcov_test" etc.
- Additional slides in PDF for virtual subprojects.
  Notes about "virtual subproject" in examples/.
- Notes in examples/hello_dictd and other examples based on
  mkc.subprj.mk about what mkc.prjs.mk really does. Reference (man page)
  is not enough for newcomers. Notes about clean-SUBPRJ, all-SUBPRJ etc.
- Better explain ../Makefile.inc included automatically. For those who
  are not familiar with *BSD it is not obvious how to use it.
- Some important mk-configure features work ONLY if mkcmake is run
  from top-level directory like "mkcmake all-subprojects" but doesn't work
  if you run "mkcmake -C subprojects all". It makes sense to add new
  variable, say, TOPDIR which, if set (by user), will force rerun mkcmake
  from the top-level directory. Another option for this variable is to
  *not* check ../Makefile.inc from the top-level directory.
- "errorcheck/configure" tests should be run in parallel. Something
  like shlock(1) or flock(1) is needed for this.
- Exit with error if any two of the following are defined: PROG,
  PROGS, LIB, SUBPRJ, SUBDIR. It is impossible (bad practice in my
  view) to combine program and library in one subproject.
- Example is needed for how to embed autoconf-based subproject into a
  project based on mk-configure. The sad fact is autoconf/automake is
  everywhere. So, it would be nice integrate mk-c into reality.
  mkc_imp.autotools.mk is needed for this.
- Exit with error if subproject contains dash. Dash is separator between
  target and subproject.
- FIX: target "depend" relies on NetBSD version of mkdep(1) which is
  incompatible with most other mkdeps(1) implementations. TODO:
  autodetection of mkdep/nbmkdep/makedepend at mk-configure build
  time, alternative .mk files/sections for different algorithms
  for generating .depend. Doublecheck exit status of mkdep(1) run.
- Alternative .depend generation, e.g. like it is described in GNU
  make infor files
- Higher priority for fixing handling of dependencies between
  libraries and programs. In addition examples/ is needed for
  triggering rebuild of subproject if "something" was rebuild in
  another subproject (build script for example).
- For better extensibility it makes sense to implement user-implementable
  pre_all, post_all, pre_install, post_install etc. targets.
- SYSCONFDIR is absent in the documentation.
- Interdependencies between targetX-subprjA and targetY-subprjB (for
  example all-prject1 and install-prject2). Maybe this is cool idea
  for examples/ and slides. I need some good example for this.
  <<<depend-project1:errorcheck-autotools_based_project2>>>!!!
- Steal cool features from Simon Gerraty's mk files and analyse
  "meta mode" he invented.
- Better support for working without installation to /. -rpath, additional
  directories for objects, binaries and libs.

-------------------------
.export is relatively new feature, check bmake version at startup
-------------------------
Warn about project names containing `-' (dash)
-----------------------------------------
gcc -L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib     -o hello_lex hello_lex.o   -ll
yacc    calc.y
mv y.tab.c calc.c
gcc   -I/usr/pkg/include   -c     -o calc.o calc.c
gcc -L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib     -o hello_calc calc.o
ERROR: cannot find program -y
Cannot find bison, good bye!
------------------------------------------

  mkc_imp.own -- useless, copy it to mkc_imp.init.mk,
  top-level mkc.init.mk, remove mkc.own.mk

  custom test failed -> exit status of mkcmake should not be zero
  MKC_CUSTOM_ERR.qqqq -> error message before exiting just like 

  mkcmake configure doesn't work
  New variable MKC_CUSTOM_ENV.xxx

  Add script_check to MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM
               Ex.  MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM+=               nested_funcs
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.nested_funcs=      nested_funcs.c
                    MKC_CUSTOM_FN.script_check=      checks/script_check

  - BINSUBDIR, LIBSUBDIR, LIBEXECSUBDIR etc...
  - Fix USE_SSP support for clang (-mllvm -stack-protector-buffer-size=1)
  - @sysconfdir@/mkc.conf
  - LDFLAGS vs. LDFLAGS in link.me (global paths before project's)
  - "mkcmake all" ignores MKC_REQD
  - BMAKE_REQD - minimum required bmake version
  - Reimplement linkme.mk. It is not flexible enough.
  - USE_RPATH
  - OBJCOPTS_<proj>
  - Regression tests:
    * optional .f tests
    * optional .p tests
    * optional .m tests
    * optional(!) glib2 tests

============================================================
Plan 1)

  - Support for MKDEBUG like in NetBSD mk files
  - .lua.luac:
  - Implement mkc_imp.libtool.mk to build
    the shared libraries using GNU libtool(1).
  - MKSTRIP, STRIP, mkc_install: use STRIP, not STRIPPROG

  Slides for:
    - Slide "extensibility" about Lua module.
    - code specific to GNU ld(1) (.def?)

============================================================
Plan 2)

  - ./configure written in shell?
  - EXPORT_DYNAMIC_SYMBOLS - add the specified symbols to
    dynamic symbol table (GNU ld)
  - EXPORT_SYMBOLS_REGEXP

  - recheck documentation for Makefile.rec
  - Syllable, Haiku, OpenServer/UnixWare and HURD
  - lcc and tcc compilers
  - epm -> rpm, SVR4 pkg etc.
  - mkc_imp.filelist.mk
    - FL_NOPREFIX
    - FL_PERSUBPRJ
  - IRIX: "endianess" and EXPORT_SYMBOLS

============================================================
Plan 3)

  = sample for home-made .mk file (Ocaml? Pike?)
  = marker for user's custom tests that
    run generated executables, i.e. not ready
    for cross-compilation

  = symlinks to executables and libraries in ${OBJDIR}/{bin,lib}

  = support for gettext

  = xxxDIR variable for /var

  = mkclint?

  = Command line may be limited in size.
    Save defines to config.h and set HAVE_CONFIG_H to 1
    for compiling.

  = MKC_NEED_FUNCLIBS - the same as MKC_SOURCE_FUNCLIBS but
    implementation is taken from mk-c.
    Ex: MKC_NEED_FUNCLIBS += strlcat strlcpy getline

  = MKC_CUSTOM_premk, MKC_CUSTOM_postmk

  = Online tutorial

  = shared libraries support for AIX, UnixWare, Hurd, Haiku.
  = shared libraries support for nwcc and other compilers.

  = Comparison with quagmire, kBuild, CMake, scons, waf, framewerk, pmk,
    MagicMakefiles, bjam, pymake etc.

  = Often compilers need special options to compile pthread code.
    Support for MKPTHREAD=yes|no is needed.

  = implement MANBZ2?

  = man page for mkc_check_compiler

============================================================
Plan 4)

  = EXPORT_SYMBOLS for HP-UX, AIX, SCO etc.

  = Single cache file as an automatically loaded (if exists)
    bmake makefile.

  = Targets bin_rpm, bin_epm
  = Targets src_tar, src_targz, src_tarbz2

  = mkc.subdir.mk:
    - continue bulding even if some subprojects failed

  = mkc.subdir.mk, mkc.subprj.mk: reimplement ${dir}.${MACHINE}

  = MKC_CHECK_CUSTOM:
    - MKC_CUSTOM_FN=xxx.f
    - MKC_CUSTOM_FN=xxx.objc

  = user-defined postinstall and preinstall?

  = Implement mkc.qt.mk

  = Implement mkc.doxygen.mk?

============================================================
Plan 5)

  = mkc.configure.mk functionality but for bourne shell, e.g.

    Upstream creates ./configure shell script:
      MKC_CONFIG_MK=mkc_config.mk
      MKC_CONFIG_H=mkc_config.h

      MKC_CHECK_HEADERS='
        header1.h
        header2.h
        header3.h'
      MKC_CHECK_FUNCLIBS='
        func1:lib1
        func2
        func3:lib3'
      #<...>
      . mkc_configure
      mkc_run # generating mkc_config.h and mkc_config.mk

    User runs
      ./configure ...
      <any>make all

  = MKC_CHECK_DECL_TYPE (define, function|variable)

  = MKC_DEFINE_01 - -DHAVE_XXX=0 or -DHAVE_XXX=1

============================================================
Plan 6)
  = MKC_BUILTINS (from autoconf):
      broken_free_NULL,
      exit_ret_int,
      isinf, isnan, malloc_0, putenv_xxx, realloc, signal,
      snprintf, sprintf, sscanf, strerror_r, strnlen,
      sysconf, unlink, unsetenv, va_copy, va_list,
      signed_shr, int_div, chown_minus_1,...
      (autoconf.info/Particular Function Checks)

      AC_FUNC_ALLOCA
  = autoconf (Portability of headers)
  = autoconf (Particular Header Checks)
