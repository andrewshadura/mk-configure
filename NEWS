Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 29 Mar 2009 15:57:30 +0300

  Huge amount of changes were made since previous release.  Now
  mk-configure provides a number of mkc.*.mk scripts working on top of
  pkgsrc's mk files or Simon Gerraty's mk-files and therefore provides
  a replacement not only for GNU autoconf but for GNU automake too.
  It makes sense to reread README file.
  Lots of new information is there.

  Lots of examples (yes, hello_worlds applications :-) ) were created
  in examples/ subdirectory.

  Lots of new mkc.*.mk files were added. They work on top of bsd.*.mk
  files and provide new functions. See README.

  Regression tests were added. Thanks to them a number of bugs were
  detected and fixed.

  Fixes in configure.mk:
     - s/return/exit/ in ${.OBJDIR}/.error-check section.
       This bug is seen under Linux/bash.

     - bmake's variable SIZEOF.long_long was not set correctly
       (long-long din't work)

     - MKC_CHECK_SIZEOF+=type:header.h
       bmake's variable SIZEOF.<type>.<header_h> is set
       instead of plain SIZEOF.<type>

     - MKC_CHECK_HEADERS += dir/hdr.h
       bmake's variable: s/HAVE_HEADER.dir.hdr_h/HAVE_HEADER.dir_hdr_h/
       (`.' vs. `_')
       I hope this is a last change in configure.mk's API.

  My own mkc.intexts.mk bmake module (mk file).

  configure.mk:
    If CHECK_SIZEOF_xxx check fails, MKC_CFLAGS is not changed.  Only
    sucessful data type sizes are registered in MKC_CFLAGS and CFLAGS.

  mkc_check_decl, mkc_check_sizeof: they don't use MKC_COMMON_DEFINES
  environment enymore, everything should be passed through CFLAGS and
  CPPFLAGS.

  MKC_SHELL is currently disabled

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Mar 2009 11:02:29 +0200

  No CFLAGS+=-DHAVE_XXXX=0 anymore, if XXX is not found
  it is not defined at all. autoconf works the same way.

  mkc_check_xxx scripts:
      - installed to bin/ directory just like normal scripts.

      - if MKC_VERBOSE variable is equal to '1', verbose messages
        are output to stderr.

      - -h|--help options printing usage information.

      - manual pages are created.

  new variable MKC_NOCACHE, if it is set to not empty string,
  caching is disabled.

  fix in mkc_check_decl: long-long is treated as 'long long'.

  MKC_SHOW_CACHED, MKC_VERBOSE, MKC_DELETE_TMPFILES, MKC_NOCACHE
  variables: 1 - true, other values - false.

  minor clean-ups in Makefile

======================================================================
Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Mar 2009 19:35:13 +0200

  MKC_FUNCLIBS_NOAUTO.ftime.compat is replaced
  with MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS list.

     Ex.:
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS += ftime:compat crypt:crypt
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS = 1 # for disabling
                               # all potential LDADD += ...

  fix: "checking for..." messages is now sent to stderr
  before result is calculated, not after.

  Support for heirloom-sh and ancient Solaris-10 /bin/sh

  added: MKC_SHELL variable defaulting to /bin/sh, mkc_check_XXX
  scripts are run with with this shell. This is variable is mainly for
  testing purposes but who knows.

======================================================================
Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  3 Mar 2009 00:04:52 +0200

   Huge amount of changes. 0.5.0 is completely incompatible with 0.4.0
   because 0.4.0 was proof-of-concept only ;-) Everything was
   inspired by discussion in fido7.ru.unix.prog.

   Changing in API is also possible in the future until
   I stabilize it.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 21 Feb 2009 22:47:20 +0200

   First publicly available release. Happy birth day! :-)
