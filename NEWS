Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Mar 2009 19:35:13 +0200

  MKC_FUNCLIBS_NOAUTO.ftime.compat is replaced
  with MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS list.

     Ex.:
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS += ftime:compat crypt:crypt
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS = 1 # for disabling
                               # all potential LDADD += ...

  fix: "checking for..." messages is now sent to stderr
  before result is calculated, not after.

  Support for heirloom-sh and ancient Solaris-10 /bin/sh

  added: MKC_SHELL variable defaulting to /bin/sh, mkc_check_XXX
  scripts are run with with this shell. This is variable is mainly for
  testing purposes but who knows.

Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  3 Mar 2009 00:04:52 +0200

   Huge amount of changes. 0.5.0 is completely incompatible with 0.4.0
   because 0.4.0 was proof-of-concept only ;-) Everything was
   inspired by discussion in fido7.ru.unix.prog.

   Changing in API is also possible in the future until
   I stabilize it.
