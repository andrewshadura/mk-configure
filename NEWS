Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 15 Mar 2009 11:02:29 +0200

  No CFLAGS+=-DHAVE_XXXX=0 anymore, if XXX is not found
  it is not defined at all. autoconf works the same way.

  mkc_check_xxx scripts:
      - installed to bin/ directory just like normal scripts.

      - if MKC_VERBOSE variable is equal to '1', verbose messages
        are output to stderr.

      - -h|--help options printing usage information.

      - manual pages are created.

  new variable MKC_NOCACHE, if it is set to not empty string,
  caching is disabled.

  fix in mkc_check_decl: long-long is treated as 'long long'.

  MKC_SHOW_CACHED, MKC_VERBOSE, MKC_DELETE_TMPFILES, MKC_NOCACHE
  variables: 1 - true, other values - false.

  minor clean-ups in Makefile

Version 0.6.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Mar 2009 19:35:13 +0200

  MKC_FUNCLIBS_NOAUTO.ftime.compat is replaced
  with MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS list.

     Ex.:
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS += ftime:compat crypt:crypt
       MKC_NOAUTO_FUNCLIBS = 1 # for disabling
                               # all potential LDADD += ...

  fix: "checking for..." messages is now sent to stderr
  before result is calculated, not after.

  Support for heirloom-sh and ancient Solaris-10 /bin/sh

  added: MKC_SHELL variable defaulting to /bin/sh, mkc_check_XXX
  scripts are run with with this shell. This is variable is mainly for
  testing purposes but who knows.

Version 0.5.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  3 Mar 2009 00:04:52 +0200

   Huge amount of changes. 0.5.0 is completely incompatible with 0.4.0
   because 0.4.0 was proof-of-concept only ;-) Everything was
   inspired by discussion in fido7.ru.unix.prog.

   Changing in API is also possible in the future until
   I stabilize it.
